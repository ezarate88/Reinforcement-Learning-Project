# Reinforcement-Learning-Project

For this project, we were tasked with helping the agent (a wandering pirate) learn the map by using reinforcement learning to remember different paths to the treasure after finding it a few times. A majority of the code was presented to us and we were only tasked in creating the learning portion for the agent. The Q-Training Algorithm is the portion of the code that we created or worked on. 

Computer scientest in general try to solve our problems or issues through the use of computers or by helping make process more efficient with the use of the computers. One large component of this area right now is machine learning and how we can utilize computers more with this current trend and in what new and innovative ways can we implement machine learning to better serve us. In many cases, machine learning can help us in some way and whenever we as computer scientiest are approached with problems, we should explore the many ways that computers can help in those scenarios. It's always important to keep ethics in mind since we don't want to create something just for maximizing results. We have seen even through machine learning that maximizing results may not always be in the best interest of all parties and whenever that happens, we need to be mindful of the consequences and how they effect our system/societies as a whole.
